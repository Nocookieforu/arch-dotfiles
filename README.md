## Dotfiles and configs for Arch Linux

This repo contains the settings used for a basic installation of Arch Linux.
The files here are stored locally in the '~/.config' directory.

Rather than copy the dotfiles into the home directory, they are symlinked 
so that changes made to the files always exist in this git repo.
